# FullyCoupledHyporheicFlowRTSolver
This solver package is designed and programmed to solve flow and transport processes in hyproheic zone. The numverical solvers included in this package are based on OpenFOAM-5.x. The surface flow is solved by the original OpenFOAM multiphase flow solver, interFoam. The transport process is solved by **** to include the interface effect
